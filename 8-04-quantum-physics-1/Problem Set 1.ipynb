    "\n",
    "   In a classical universe, we might try to build a hydrogen atom by placing an electron in a circular orbit around a proton. We know, however, that a non-relativistic, accelerating electron radiates energy at a rate given by the Larmor formula:\n",

    "   \n",
    "   Here $e$ is the electron charge and $a$ is the magnitude of the electron acceleration. So the classical atom may have a stability problem. We want to figure out how big is this effect. In the units we are working the electron potential energy in the presence of the proton is $V = \\frac{−e^2}{r}$ and the magnitude of the force of attraction is $e^2/r^2$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   a) Show that for a non-relativistic electron the energy $\\Delta E$ lost per revolution is small compared to the electron’s kinetic energy $K$. Do this by computing the ratio $\\Delta E / K$. Hence, it is possible to regard the orbit as circular at any instant, even though the electron eventually spirals into the proton.\n",
