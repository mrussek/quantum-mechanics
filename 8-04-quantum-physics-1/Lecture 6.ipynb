    "## Normalizable wavefunctions and the question of time evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lecture, we discussed the interpretation of the wavefunction. In particular, we came up with the so called _Born rule_, which states that the probability of a particle being found in an infinitesimal region $\\d{x}$ is given by $\\Psi^*(x, t)\\Psi(x, t)$. Alternatively, we can say that the probability of finding the particle within the interval $[a, b]$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(a \\le x \\le b) = \\int_b^a{\\Psi^*(x, t)\\Psi(x, t)}\\d{x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can assume that, if we indeed have a one-dimensional particle, that particle must be found _somewhere_. Specifically, we must have that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(-\\infty \\le x \\le \\infty) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{\\Psi^*(x, t)\\Psi(x, t)\\d{x}} = 1.\n",
    "\\label{eq:normalization} \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we would hope that this would continue to be true at all times, not at just some particular time. Can we show that if $\\eqref{eq:normalization}$ holds for some particular time $t_0$, it must hold for all $t$? In other words, when the wave function evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, is the normalization preserved?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we note a simple consequence of $\\eqref{eq:normalization}$. In order for the integral to exist, we must for example have that $\\Psi(x, t) \\to 0$ for $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, since otherwise $|\\Psi(x, t)|^2$ will continue to contribute to the integral and thus the integral will diverge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Technically, we do not have to have that $\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} \\Psi(x, t) = 0$, since the limit may technically not exist. We do have that $\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} \\Psi(x, t) = 0$ if the limit exists at all. However, the situations where this might occur are unphysical and may be ignored, so we may take $\\Psi \\to 0$ for $x \\to \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty}{\\Psi(x, t)} = 0 \\label{eq:zero}\\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will also assume that for sufficient $x$,  $\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x}$ will be bounded. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    ", \\forall x, |x| > x_0\\quad\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x} \\le C \\label{eq:bounded}\\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Earlier, we said that the Schrödinger equation was _linear_, and so any linear combination of solutions was itself a solution. Note that this would imply that if we had a normalized wavefunction $\\Psi(x, t)$, we would also have a solution $c\\Psi(x, t)$ whose normalization $|c\\Psi(x, t)|^2 = c^2|\\Psi(x, t)|^2 = c^2 \\ne 1$. While this is true, first we note that any wave function that has finite integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{|\\Psi(x, t)|^2\\d{x}} = C < \\infty$, we can construct an equivalent wave function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C}}\\Psi(x, t)$ that has normalization 1. We refer to such functions as _normalizable_ wave functions as opposed to normalized wave functions. Note that trivially, normalizable wave functions are closed under finite linear combination. So long as we restrict our solutions to normalizable wave functions, we can simply convert our wave function to a normalized wave function before calculating probabilities with the Born rule."
